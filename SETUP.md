# Setup Instructions for NPM Publishing

This document provides step-by-step instructions to complete the npm publishing setup.

## üîë Required: Set up NPM Token

Before you can publish to npm, you need to create an npm access token and add it to GitHub:

### 1. Create NPM Access Token

1. Log in to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com)
2. Click on your profile icon ‚Üí "Access Tokens"
3. Click "Generate New Token" ‚Üí "Classic Token"
4. Select "Automation" as the token type
5. Copy the generated token (you won't be able to see it again!)

### 2. Add Token to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `NPM_TOKEN`
5. Value: Paste your npm access token
6. Click "Add secret"

## üöÄ Publishing the Package

### First Time Setup

Before publishing for the first time, you may need to claim the package name:

1. Make sure you're logged in to npm: `npm login`
2. Run: `npm publish --access public` (from the repository root)
   - Or wait for the GitHub Action to do this automatically

### Automatic Publishing

After the initial setup, the package will be automatically published:

1. Create a new GitHub release (manually or via automation)
2. When the release is published, the "Publish to npm" workflow triggers
3. The workflow:
   - Updates the version based on the cache number
   - Checks if the version is already published
   - Creates a git tag
   - Publishes to npm (if new version)

### Manual Publishing

You can also trigger publishing manually:

1. Go to: **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select: "Publish to npm" workflow
3. Click: "Run workflow"
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Click: "Run workflow"

## üìã Verification

After the first publish, verify it worked:

1. Check npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/osrs-db
2. Test installation: `npm install osrs-db`
3. Test import in a Node.js project:
   ```javascript
   const items = require('osrs-db/items.g.json');
   console.log(`Items: ${items.length}`);
   ```

## üîÑ Updating the Code Version

The version format is `1.X.cacheNumber` where:
- `1` = Major version (for breaking changes)
- `X` = Code version (for feature updates)
- `cacheNumber` = Auto-updated from cache

To increment the code version (middle number):

1. Edit `package.json`
2. Change version from `1.0.2317` to `1.1.2317` (or whatever is appropriate)
3. Commit and push
4. The next publish will use the new code version with the latest cache number

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "403 Forbidden" Error

- Verify `NPM_TOKEN` is set correctly in GitHub secrets
- Make sure the token hasn't expired
- Ensure you have publish permissions for the package

### "Version already exists" Error

- This is normal if the cache hasn't been updated
- The workflow will automatically skip publishing in this case
- Wait for the next cache update

### Git Tag Conflicts

If a tag already exists:
- The workflow will skip tag creation (this is normal)
- The publish will still proceed if the npm version doesn't exist
