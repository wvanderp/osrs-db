# OSRS-db

`A project for collecting machine readable data for OSRS`

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

We can not maintain this database without the solid foundation laid by the following projects:

- [RuneLite](https://runelite.net/): for demystifying the cache and creating the cache exporter
- [OSRSBox](https://www.osrsbox.com/blog/2018/07/26/osrs-cache-research-extract-cache-definitions/): for in turn demystifying the build process of actually compiling RuneLite

- [OSRS Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/): for providing the most comprehensive database of items, monsters, and everything else in OSRS
  - And in particular, the lists of [item stats](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Armoury) for the most comprehensive list of item stats in the game
